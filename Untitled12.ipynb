        "This project presents an AI-driven music recommendation system that dynamically suggests songs based on a user's current mood. The system integrates Natural Language Processing (NLP) for mood detection from textual inputs and uses audio feature extraction (valence, energy, tempo) via the Spotify API to classify song moods. A hybrid recommendation engine combining sentiment analysis, audio features, and cosine-similarity–based ranking is implemented to recommend songs that match or enhance emotional states. A Streamlit-based web interface allows real‑time interaction. Results demonstrate accurate mood classification and improved personalized recommendations. Applications include wellness apps, music streaming services, mental health tools, and entertainment platforms.\n",

        "Music plays a central role in human emotions and well-being. People often choose songs based on their mood—happy, sad, romantic, calm, or energetic. Traditional recommendation systems mainly use popularity, genre, or historical behavior, which fail to capture the emotional alignment between a listener and a song. This project aims to create a mood-aware recommendation system that tailors music suggestions to a user’s emotional state using modern NLP and machine‑learning approaches.\n",
